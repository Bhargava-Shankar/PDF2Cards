History and the environment
Environment葉hat is a world alive and related to a living centre, the
habitat of an animal, the hunting grounds and pastures of nomads, thefields of settled peasants. For human beings the environment is both anobjective ecological condition and a field of subjective experience. Naturesets limits, man transgresses them with his tools and his vision. Manprogressively creates a specific environment and makes history. In thisprocess it is not only the limits set by nature which are transgressed butalso the limits of human experience and cognition. From the elementaryadaptation to the natural environment to the establishment of greatcivilisations, the horizon of experience and the regional extension ofhuman relations constantly expand.
The conception of the environment changes in the course of this
evolution. Ecological conditions which may appear hostile to man at onestage of this evolution may prove to be attractive and inviting at anotherstage. The hunter and foodgatherer armed only with stone tools preferred tolive on the edge of forests near the plains or in open river valleys, areaswhich were less attractive to the settled peasant who cut the trees andreclaimed fertile soil. But initially even the peasant looked for lighter soilsuntil a sturdy plough and draught animals enabled him to cope with heavysoils. At this stage the peasant could venture to open up fertile alluvial plainsand reap rich harvests of grain. If rainfall or irrigation were sufficient hecould grow that most productive but most demanding of all grains: rice.Wherever irrigated rice was produced, plenty of people could live and greatempires could rise, but, of course, such civilisations and empires were verymuch dependent on their agrarian base. A change of climate or a devastationof this base by invaders cut off their roots and they withered away.
Indian history provides excellent examples of this evolution. Prehistoric
sites with stone tools were almost exclusively found in areas which were notcentres of the great empires of the later stages of history: the area betweenUdaipur and Jaipur, the valley of the Narmada river, the eastern slopes of theWestern Ghats, the country between the rivers Krishna and TungabhadraINTRODUCTION
2(Raichur Doab), the area of the east coast where the highlands are nearest
to the sea (to the north of present Madras), the rim of the Chota NagpurPlateau and both slopes of the mountain ranges of central India (see Map 1).
The cultivation of grain started around 7000 BC in Southern Asia,
according to recent archaeological research. This was a time of increasingrainfall in the region which has always depended on the monsoon. Beforeventuring into the open plains of the lower Indus the precursors of theIndus civilisation experimented with cultivating alluvial lands on a smallscale in the valleys of Baluchistan. There they built stone walls(gabarbands)  which retained the sediments of the annual inundation.
Initially the archaeologists mistook these walls for dams built forirrigation, but the holes in these walls showed that they were designed soas to retain soil but not water. Such constructions were found near Quettaand Las Bela and in the Bolan valley. In this valley is also the site ofMehrgarh which will be described in detail in the next chapter.
Palaeobotanical research has indicated an increase in rainfall in this
whole region from about 3000 BC. The new methods of cultivatingalluvial soil were then adopted not only in the Indus valley, but also in theparallel Ghaggar valley some 60 to 80 miles to the east of the Indus. Thisvalley was perhaps even more attractive to the early cultivators than theIndus valley with its enormous inundations and a flow of water twice thatof the Nile. The builders of the great cities Mohenjo-Daro and Harappawere masters of water management as the systems of urban water supplyand sewerage show. So far no village sites have been found in the Indusvalley. Perhaps due to the inundations agricultural operations were onlyseasonal and no permanent villages were established. The cities may haveserved as organisational centres for such seasonal operations. They werealso very important centres of trade. Harappa which was situated near theborderline between agriculture and the pastoral zone served as a gatewaycity on which the trade routes coming from the north converged. Metalsand precious stones came from the mountains and entered internationalmaritime trade via the big Indus cities.
Life in the Ghaggar valley may have been of a different kind. There was
a much greater density of settlements there. It was probably the heartlandof this civilisation. The site of Ganweriwala, near Derawar Fort, which hasbeen identified but not yet excavated, may contain the remains of a city asbig as Harappa. It is surrounded by a large cluster of smaller sites. Perhapshere one could find the rural settlements which are conspicuous by theirabsence in the Indus valley. Archaeological evidence points to a drying upof the Ghaggar around 1700 BC which may be due to a sudden tectonicchange. The river Yamuna which now parallels the Ganga is supposed tohave flowed through the Ghaggar valley until an upheaval in the foothillsof the Himalayas made it change its course. The distance between thepresent valley of the Yamuna and the ancient Ghaggar valley is less thanINTRODUCTION
340 miles in the area between Jagadhri and Ambala. The land is rather flat
in this area and even a small tectonic tilt could have caused the shift in theflow of the river. The northward thrust of the subcontinental shelf whichthrew up the Himalayas causes tectonic movements even today, as frequentearthquakes indicate. Other tectonic upheavals at the mouth of the Indusriver may have produced a large lake submerging Mohenjo-Daro. Thislatter hypothesis is contested by scholars who think that the mighty Induscould never have been blocked for any length of time. However, even onesudden blockage or several seasonal ones would have done enoughdamage. The drying up of the Ghaggar and the blocking of the lower Induscould thus have ruined the major centres of the Indus civilisation.
There was one region which remained initially unaffected by these
upheaveals: the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat. This region had beencolonised by the people of the Indus civilisation and had emerged as a majorlink with the outside world. Only a few sites have been excavated there sofar. Dholavira is a site to watch. It lies far inside the Rann of Kutch, but itwas obviously a seaport like Lothal on the other side of the peninsula.Clearly, Dholavira is an important site. Maritime trade via Oman broughtAfrican millets to this region where inland settlements like Rojdi lived oncultivating them rather than wheat and barley which were the mainstay ofthe Indus civilisation elsewhere. The millets were of great importance for thespread of settled agriculture into the highlands further to the east.
The total area covered by the Indus civilisation was very large. So-called
Late Harappan remains have been found even at Daimabad inMaharashtra. Shortugai in Badakshan, Afghanistan, is so far the mostnorthern settlement of the Indus civilisation located by archaeologists. Thedistance between Shortugai and Daimabad is about 1,500 miles. Suchdistant outposts, as well as cities not threatened by tectonic upheavals,decayed when the heartland no longer provided trade and culturalsupervision. The vigour of the Indus civilisation had thus been sapped longbefore the tribes of cattle-rearing nomads who called themselves Aryans(the noble ones) descended from the north. The ecological scenario facedby these newcomers was very different from that which had given rise tothe Indus civilisation. As nomads they could adjust to a changingenvironment. Initially the plains of the Panjab provided rich pastures fortheir cattle until a sharp decrease in rainfall drove them eastwards, to thejungles of the Ganga-Yamuna river system which receded in this period ofperennial drought.
THE ROUTES OF ARYAN MIGRATION
The main thrust of Aryan migration was probably south of the Terai
region where the tributaries of the river Ganga must have dwindled to thepoint that they could be easily crossed and where the dry forest could be1INTRODUCTION
